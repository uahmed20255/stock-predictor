# Apple Inc. Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project implements an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict Apple Inc.'s closing stock prices using historical data from the last 60 days.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data
The model uses Apple Inc.'s historical stock data (open, high, low, close, volume). You can obtain this data from sources like Yahoo Finance.

Model Architecture
The LSTM model takes 60 days of stock data as input and predicts the next day's closing price. It consists of:

LSTM layers to capture time dependencies
Dense layers for output prediction
Training
To train the model:

Load and preprocess the data.
Train the LSTM model on the data.
Evaluate performance on the test set.
python
Copy code
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)
Usage
Download and preprocess Apple stock data.
Train the model on historical data.
Use the model to predict future closing prices.
