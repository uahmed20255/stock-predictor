Install dependencies:




# Data
The model uses Apple Inc.'s historical stock data (open, high, low, close, volume). You can obtain this data from sources like Yahoo Finance.

# Model Architecture
The LSTM model takes 60 days of stock data as input and predicts the next day's closing price. It consists of:

# LSTM layers to capture time dependencies
Dense layers for output prediction
